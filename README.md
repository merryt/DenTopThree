# DenTopThree
===========

Top three in Denver. 

Top three Pigeons?
Top three Pizzas?
Top three Intersections?

You tell us! DenTopThree is a fast acting crowd sourced top 3 list built with Yeoman, Grunt, Bower, and Node.

## Setup

So simple this is the TL;DR for now. Run Node install and Bower install and you should be good to go with Grunt. Lets review:

Setup:

	```npm install```

	```bower install```

and finally, run it:

	```grunt serve```

It should open a browser window at port 9000 by default but feel free to do you're own thing, we're not too picky.
